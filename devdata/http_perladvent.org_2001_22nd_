How many times have you got an email where the whole thing was on one
line because the sender's client didn't chop the message up into
72char length lines? Or had someone apply creative formatting to the
message with a terrible cut and paste? It'd be nice if you could get a
program to smarten up text like this...to make it more readable. Of
course correcting these kinds of problems is more than simply trivial.</p>
<p>One of the major problems with reformatting is that email contains
quoted text and simply reformatting it naive manner simply doesn't
work - you end up with the quotation delimiters being reformatted as
if they were any other words and ending up in the middle of
lines. <b>Text::Autoformat</b> is a module that has a good stab at
reformatting the text to look less disorganised. The great thing is
that <b>Text::Autoformat</b> is clever (or at least cunning) and knows
what to do with email quoting and wraps the text without the quotes
and then adds and removes quotes until the original format was there
again.</p>
<p>This isn't the only situation <b>Text::Autoformat</b> knows how to deal
with; It has a whole plethora of other reformatting options from
reordering numbered lists to providing full justification if you
really want it. <b>Text::Autoforma</b>t isn't always able to determine the
correct thing to do with any input (that problem is Hard,) so
sometimes it screws up. Nine times out of ten however, you end up with
text that looks a lot better than when you applied it.</p>
